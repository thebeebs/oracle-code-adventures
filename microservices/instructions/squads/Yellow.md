It is now time to select your weapon of choice.

2. Copy the preferred Weapon's Git Clone Command from above. Discuss with your squad members to make sure you are not using the same one! 

3. Enter your developer enivronment, at the bottom of your screen, press the Terminal tab. Paste the Git Clone Command that you just copied and hit Enter. You should now be asked for your password, it should be handed out to you and is the same password as you use to access the Cloud services. **Paste the password using Ctrl + V as our environment does not support paste using mouse click.**
